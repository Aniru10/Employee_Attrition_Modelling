# Employee_Attrition_Modelling

Employee attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced.

Attrition is an inevitable part of any business. There will come a time when an employee wants to leave your company – for either personal or professional reasons. But there are other reasons for attrition as well, including the lack of professional growth, a hostile work environment, or declining confidence in the company’s market value. Weak leadership is another factor that often drives attrition among employees.

  
## What Are the Different Types of Attrition?
  

There are five types of employee attrition that you need to know of: 
1. **Attrition due to retirement** <br>
  If two or three people have retired from your company this year, this is statistically too small an employee group to count under attrition. However, if a sizable chunk of your workforce retires at the same time, this can cause attrition. Attrition due to retirement shouldn’t be swept under the rug – your senior professionals may choose to retire early or become independent consultants due to factors other than age.
  
2. **Voluntary attrition**<br>
  This is the most common type of attrition, where employees decide to simply quit their jobs. There can be many reasons for voluntary attrition (more on that later) and most of them are in your control.
  
3. **Involuntary attrition**
  In this scenario, it is the company and not the employee that initiates the exit. For example, the employee may have shown instances of misconduct in the workplace – a common reason for involuntary attrition. Structural reasons could also cause attrition. Mergers and acquisitions are often followed by a wave of involuntary attrition.
  
4. **Internal attrition**<br>
  Here, employees are quitting their jobs in one department to join another department. In some cases, internal attrition is desirable, as it routes talent towards more profitable areas. It also ensures better employee-job fitment. But if a specific department has witnessed a high rate of attrition one year, it merits an investigation. Is there something missing in the job? Is the manager inadequately skilled? These are questions that HR needs to ask and find answers to.
  
5. **Demographic-specific attrition**<br>
  This is a significant concern for progressive companies trying to build an equal-opportunities workplace. Demographic-specific attrition means that employees from a single group – women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, veterans, or older professionals – are leaving the company in droves. You need to immediately deploy employee surveys to identify the root cause of demographics-based attrition before it affects your workplace culture. A positive culture can be the antidote to the quitting epidemic.
